<p><strong>The Data Center Immersion Cooling Fluid Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-phase Immersion Cooling</li><li>Two-phase Immersion Cooling</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The data center immersion cooling fluid market is divided into two categories: single-phase immersion cooling and two-phase immersion cooling. Single-phase immersion cooling involves completely submerging IT equipment in a non-conductive fluid to dissipate heat. This method is efficient, cost-effective, and suitable for various data center applications. On the other hand, two-phase immersion cooling uses specialized fluids with a low boiling point. The fluid evaporates on contact with hot components, removing heat more effectively. Both solutions offer enhanced cooling capabilities and are employed in data centers for efficient heat management.</p></p>
