<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The HAA (Heat Activated) Cover Tape Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-conductive</li><li>Static Dissipative</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The HAA (Heat Activated) Cover Tape market includes two types: Non-conductive and Static Dissipative. Non-conductive cover tapes are designed to insulate electronic components from static electricity and prevent damage. They do not conduct electrical charge and provide a barrier against static build-up. On the other hand, Static Dissipative cover tapes allow controlled dissipation of static charges, protecting sensitive components from damage caused by electrostatic discharge. Both types serve to safeguard electronic parts during shipping, storage, and handling, ensuring their integrity and functionality.</p></p>
