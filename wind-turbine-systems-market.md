<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wind Turbine Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Horizontal Axis</li><li>Vertical Axis</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Wind turbine systems can be categorized into two main types: horizontal axis and vertical axis. Horizontal axis wind turbines are the most commonly used and recognizable type, featuring blades that rotate horizontally around a central hub. They are more efficient in higher wind speeds and can generate more power. On the other hand, vertical axis wind turbines have blades that rotate vertically around a central axis. They are more compact and suitable for urban environments, where wind direction may vary. Both types have their advantages and can be utilized based on specific requirements and location conditions.</p></p>
