<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gypsum Foaming Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stable Foaming Agents</li><li>Unstable Foaming Agents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gypsum foaming agents are divided into two types: stable foaming agents and unstable foaming agents. Stable foaming agents have a longer lifespan and maintain their foaming properties over time, ensuring consistent and predictable results in gypsum-based applications. On the other hand, unstable foaming agents are short-lived and lose their foaming properties relatively quickly, leading to less predictable outcomes. The choice between the two types depends on the specific requirements and desired performance of the gypsum-based products being produced.</p></p>
