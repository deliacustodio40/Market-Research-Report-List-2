<p><ul><li>Rotary Type</li><li>Foil Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Wet electric shavers are divided into two main types: rotary and foil. Rotary shavers use rotating blades beneath a metal cover, allowing them to navigate the contours of the face easily. These shavers are suitable for longer, coarser hair. On the other hand, foil shavers have oscillating blades hidden under a thin layer of metal mesh, capturing and cutting hair as it passes through the holes. Foil shavers are more suitable for sensitive skin and give a closer shave. Both types of shavers are designed for use in wet conditions, such as in the shower or with shaving cream.</p></p>
