<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electro Absorption Modulators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorptive Modulators</li><li>Refractive Modulators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electro Absorption Modulators are used in optical communication systems to control the intensity of light. Absorptive modulators work by absorbing the light and converting it into heat, causing the intensity to decrease. On the other hand, refractive modulators use the refractive index of a material to modulate the light intensity. By changing the refractive index, the light travels through the material at different speeds, resulting in a change in intensity. Both types of modulators play a crucial role in achieving efficient and accurate light intensity control in various applications.</p></p>
