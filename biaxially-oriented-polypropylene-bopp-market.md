<p><strong>The Biaxially Oriented Polypropylene (BOPP) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tubular Quench Method</li><li>Flat Film Strength Method</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Biaxially Oriented Polypropylene (BOPP) is a type of polypropylene film that is stretched in both the machine and transverse directions to improve its strength, clarity, and barrier properties. The market for BOPP films includes two types: tubular quench method and flat film strength method. Tubular quench method involves extruding molten polypropylene resin into a tubular shape, which is then cooled and collapsed to form a flat film. On the other hand, flat film strength method is a sequential process of stretching and annealing a flat film.</p></p>
